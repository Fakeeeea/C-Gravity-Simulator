# C-Gravity-Simulator

This project was a fun way of learning gravitational interactions between planets after learning that in school.
Its made in C using wingdi to draw out the simulation, which was really, really boring to learn.

It allows for multiple planets to be inserted, limited by how much your screen can show (Will have to insert a scroll bar,
so one can insert as many as he wants).

# UI

3 main options (buttons): <br>
ADD - add a planet; <br>
SET - change precision (Milliseconds - Seconds- Minutes - Hours) -> of how much is speed multiplied or divided at every interaction, hours will be less precise than milliseconds for instance; <br>
DEL - delete last added planet; <br>

# Commands

Keyboard commands:<br>
Arrow-left - go forward; <br>
J - Zoom in;<br>
K - Zoom out;<br>

If you have any suggestions for the code feel free to comment. I am still learning, thanks.
